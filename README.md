# Deep-Learning
My Deep Learning Showcase
It has three folders:

# 1:    neuralnetwork 

This folder contains the implementation of neurel network from scratch using just numpy. 

# 2:    MachineLearning

This folder contains the demos of linear regression and SVM Classification using traditional Machine Leearning.

# 3:    ConvolutionNeuralNetwork

This folder contains the implementation of Convolutional neurel network from scratch using just numpy.
